# php-instagram-downloader

UPDATE 1: Due to the Facebook Privacy Scandal, Facebook and Instagram API has changed on April 3, 2018 causing developers to have limited access to user data. Hence this whole code is outdated and doesnt work.

Php code using Instagram API to download all the pics from an Instagram profile and save it in a folder

1. Visit https://www.instagram.com/developer/ and Sign In.
2. Click on Manage Clients and Register a New Client to get Client ID and Client Secret (Don't tell these values to anyone, they are very important).
3. Put these values in the PHP code which I have written.

Note: Change the value of the 'count' in the php file to download that number of photos at once.
Note: Only profiles with sandbox mode can use this application. Submit your client to Instagram for review and let them accept it so that everyone can use this feature.
