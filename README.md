# php-instagram-downloader
Php code using Instagram API to download all the pics from an Instagram profile and save it in a folder

1. Visit https://www.instagram.com/developer/ and Sign In.
2. Click on Manage Clients and Register a New Client to get Client ID and Client Secret (Don't tell these values to anyone, they are very important).
3. Put these values in the PHP code which I have written.

Note: Change the value of the 'count' in the php file to download that number of photos at once.
